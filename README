AI::NeuralNet::BackProp is a simply back-propagation,
feed-foward neural network designed to learn using
a generalization of the Delta rule and a bit of Hopefield
theory. Still in beta stages.

Be sure to checkout the ./examples/ directory for 5 different
example scripts using the AI::NeuralNet::BackProp network.

Use it, let me know what you all think. This is just a
groud-up write of a neural network, no code stolen or
anything else. It uses the -IDEA- of back-propagation
for error correction, with the -IDEA- of the delta
rule and hopefield theory, as I understand them. So, don't expect
a classicist view of nerual networking here. I simply wrote
from operating theory, not math theory. Any die-hard neural
networking gurus out there? Let me know how far off I am with
this code! :-)
	
Thankyou all for your help.
